I tried to make an online blog where users could write their own posts with a rich text editor. It's a big challenge because I'm not familiar with databases. I'm using Prisma to connect to the database. I refer to many projects when I build this website such as [prisma/fullstack-prisma-nextjs-blog](https://github.com/prisma/fullstack-prisma-nextjs-blog).

- Database: [Supabase](https://supabase.com/)

- Rich text editor: [Tiptap](https://tiptap.dev)
- Authentication: [NextAuth](https://next-auth.js.org)
- Icon: [Tabler icons](https://tabler-icons.io/)
- UI: [Mantine](https://mantine.dev)

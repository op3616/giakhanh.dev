## Why have this blog?

> Because sharing is learning

I started this blog as a way to document and share the things I have learned and found useful in my journey as a software engineer.

Writing and noting things down is a great way for me to solidify my understanding of new concepts and technologies,
and I hope that my blog can be a helpful resource for others who are interested in web development, eCommerce, and related technologies.

I would be highly appreciated if you could leave your comments and thoughts on what I have written.

Thanks to **Timothy Lin** for the
[tailwind-nextjs-starter-blog](https://github.com/timlrx/tailwind-nextjs-starter-blog). It helped me when I haven't any idea how to create a blog from scratch. My code isn't like the starter code because I changed a lot of code :)
